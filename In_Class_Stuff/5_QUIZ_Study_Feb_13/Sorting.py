# sorting
# Every Python list has a sort method that sorts it in place.
# If you donâ€™t want to mess up your list, you can use the
# sorted function, which returns a new list:

x = [4, 1, 2, 3]
y = sorted(x)     # y is [1, 2, 3, 4], x is unchanged
x.sort()          # now x is [1, 2, 3, 4]

# reverse sorting
# sort the list by absolute value from largest to smallest
x = sorted([-4, 1, -2, 3], key=abs, reverse=True)  # is [-4, 3, -2, 1]

# sort the words and counts from highest count to lowest
wc = sorted(word_counts.items(),
            key=lambda word_and_count: word_and_count[1],
            reverse=True)
